# squareseq

Simple implementation for making sequences where the sum of all adjacent pairs
is a perfect square.

Mostly just working out how to implement things like memoization in Rust, and
use benchmarking and profiling to find inefficiencies in my implementation
choices.

In the future I want to try to build a state machine and some other
data structures to tackle the problem. Maybe a graph based implementation would
prove interesting? Inefficient but interesting.
